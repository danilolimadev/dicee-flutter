# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## Goal

The objective of this app is to lern the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I will build in the future. This app teach me how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I create

I did a a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button.
